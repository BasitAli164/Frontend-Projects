          <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
          <div>
            <Button1 btnText="Read More" />
            <Button2 btnText= "Hire"/>
          </div>

</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
      
    </>
